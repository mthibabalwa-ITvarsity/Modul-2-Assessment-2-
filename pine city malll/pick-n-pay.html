               <p>Pick n Pay is an inclusive brand focused on being the retailer for all â€“ from the most affluent in society to those who are less fortunate and for whom price is of the utmost importance. Middle-income South African consumers make up the largest portion of our customer base. Pick n Pay operates on an owned and franchise basis and provides a wide range of products and value-added services that include an online offering. Pick n Pay is focused on delivering an exceptional customer offer, including range, quality, price, availability and service. Pick n Pay has a strong growth plan that benefits from flexible formats and a leaner operating model. Pick n Pay is focused on bringing its offer to communities where we are not yet well represented, including through small convenience stores.</p>
