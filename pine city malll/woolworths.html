               <p>Woolworths conjures up images of the best quality in everything – from fantastic food to fashion and household textiles. The store in the Waterfront is certainly no exception. The supermarket offers an array of delights such as imported filter coffee, preserves and delicious pasta to the freshest produce that money can buy. There is also a huge choice of pre-made foods or, for the chef in you, a selection of the best ingredients from across the world. And then there is the clothing, which caters to all fashion needs tight from garments for new-born babies to the latest styles for adults. In addition, there is an enormous department devoted to homeware, where you can select from the latest in bed linen, bathroom towels and stunning crockery and cutlery – there is so much more at Woolworths.</p>
